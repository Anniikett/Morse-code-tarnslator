# Morse-code-tarnslator
Morse code is a method used in telecommunication to encode text characters as standardized sequences of two different signal durations,called dots and dashes, or dits and dahs. 
Morse code is named after Samuel Morse, one of the inventors of the telegraph. 
A morse code translator which can convert plain text into encrypted form as morse code and also it can convert morse code back into plain text. 
A simple tool which can easily convert your plain text having alphabates from A to Z, numbers from 0 to 9 and some special symbols into a encrypted morse code format. Also it can convert your morse code into plain text.

MORSE CODE

Morse code is a method of converting plain text into a series of on-off tones, lights or clicks or some dots & dashes format text which can be understood only by a skilled listener or observer.

ALGORITHM FOR MORSE CODE TRANSLATOR

The algorithm for morse code translator is very simple. In this we have convert each alphabet into its corresponding dot & dashes or only with dot or dashes in some cases and vice-versa.
